How do I approach designing software?
When approaching software I always like to set realistic goals that I know will not require too much effort off the bat to complete. I Like to have a owkring verison before adding to many features.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The major design skill I used in this course is the ability to simplify steps to make the process easier. This was making functions that steamlilned the rendering process.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed the design process that I saw used in the tutorials. Make a simple version and then expand on that. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
My design approach allows me to understand and think about what I want and what I can acheive. I need to acheive a certian goal before getting to what I want. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I always like to set a goal, as long as the goal I make isnt too hard at first, I have the confidence to complete it. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I normally dont create a ton of functions when I program. Making modular code helped me see how cledan you can make your code get by doing so.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Understanding that the Urendeer() function is ran every frame allowed me to see that curtain things shouldnt happen in the Iteration since it can create lag. By creating objects in every fram lag is major so creaating one object that is refernced outsound the interation stops the lag.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach ahs changed because now I like to make code modular. I never knew how important that was but now I do.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I want this to be my career so with out it I can't reach my goal. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
No, It will not.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I would say it gave me the skill to focus and deeply think about things I don't understand.
